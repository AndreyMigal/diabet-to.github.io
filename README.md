# Diabet website theme

## Working with posts

All posts are served from the `_posts` folder. To add a new post, create a new file with following format:

`<year>-<month>-<day>-<title>.md`

## Uploading images

All files stored in the `assets` folder are accessible from the website.

You can reference any file, such as an image, with `/assets/images/{filename}`.
